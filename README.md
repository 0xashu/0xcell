# Emerge

Cross-chain Conway's Game of Life. Powered by CCTP.

## What

- **PoW → Cells**: Hash your way to unique patterns
- **Any Chain**: Solana users playing on Ethereum? Yes.
- **One Click**: Send tx. Watch cells evolve. Done.

## Why

CCTP isn't just a bridge. It's cross-chain messaging infrastructure.

We're proving it.

## How

```
User (Any Chain) → CCTP Message → PoW Hash → Cell Pattern → Evolution
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xashu/emerge.git
